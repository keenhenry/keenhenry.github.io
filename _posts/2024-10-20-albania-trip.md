The first day is a day full of unexpected things:

- Didn't expect long queues at the custom control
- Didn't expect the long wait at picking up the luggage
- Didn't rent the original car that I booked
- Didn't expect the car is empty return on empty ...
- GPS signal not stable which makes navigation not working smoothly
- Took longer than expected to find our accommodation
- Didn't have time to buy and prepare dinner; just ate instant noodles

Last night I found out the location permission settings of my Android phones were problematic for navigation, i changed it. Then today
the navigation just works smoothly, it makes life much easier and no more taking the wrong paths or stop to recheck our current location.
It just made this trip feel easy again, as enjoyable as to other countries. In fact, it is even more magnificent due to amazing weather
and scenary.

- ~Mesi bridge~ (Water color is beautiful)
- ~Shengan~ (Also a blue eye :); but water color is not as beautiful as Mesi, in my personal view)
- The restaurant near Shengan was also simply brilliant, in fact, it is more enjoyrable than the lake Shengan itself. We had our lunch there. highly recommended.
- Rozafa Castle (The panorama is unbeatable, simply brilliant, can't not skip this one if you're in this region, the best panorama i've had in recent years!)
- Boodschapen doen -> cannot find fresh food in that supermarket. The logic here is a bit different, fresh food is not sold in supermarkt.
