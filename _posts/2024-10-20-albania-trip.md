The first day is a day full of unexpected things:

- Didn't expect long queues at the custom control
- Didn't expect the long wait at picking up the luggage
- Didn't rent the original car that I booked
- Didn't expect the car is empty return on empty ...
- GPS signal not stable which makes navigation not working smoothly
- Took longer than expected to find our accommodation
- Didn't have time to buy and prepare dinner; just ate instant noodles
