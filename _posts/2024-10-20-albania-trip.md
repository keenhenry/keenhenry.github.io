『為什麼選擇去阿爾巴尼亞呢？』滿多友人問。

一直想去個沒去過的國家冒險一下，剛好在電視節目[**3 op Reis**][3-op-reis]看到介紹阿爾巴尼亞，覺得不錯，
於是把該訂的訂一訂就成行了。


## 行程規劃

因為第一次去這個國家，於是花了點時間做些行前規劃。

我們預計搭飛機中午抵達Tirana Airport，然後在機場租車取車後，就直接開到阿爾巴尼亞北部靠近Montenegro邊界的Shkodër區，
入住一間**Shkodra**湖邊的民宿[**Camping Villa Lake Shkodra**][villa]。然後接下來六天基本上都在阿爾巴尼亞北部自駕
遊，規劃要去的景點包括：

- [Koman Lake tour][koman-lake]
- [Theth National Park][theth]
- Shkodër附近的景點：
  - [Mesi bridge][mesi]
  - [Rozafa Castle][rozafa] (非常推薦，俯瞰Shkodra湖和Drin河和Shkodër城極佳地點，是這區的大景之一，而且遊客不會太多)
  - [Syri i Sheganit](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E2dk395sH9Syvwzn9) (當地人稱'藍眼'的小湖)
  - 參觀[Shiroka][shiroka]小鎮
- 步行或是遊船[Shkodra Lake](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UBVRx7qK6tFysCKp6)
- Tirana市中心

出發這天請鄰居Gustavo先生載我們一程到Eindhoven Aiport搭**Wizz Air**直飛前往Tirana Airport。

登機很順利，但這是我們近年來第一次在申根區以外的歐洲國家渡假，因此是需要經過海關查驗護照的，會多花點時間。飛行時間約兩個半小時，快降落時，
從機窗外看到阿爾巴尼亞地貌的第一印象就是群山圍繞！當地天氣很好，藍天白雲像是在歡迎我們。

入境旅客還不少，長長的隊伍等待通過海關。持某些地區的護照（歐盟護照，台灣護照，中國護照，美國，英國護照等）可以自動快速通關，只要你年滿14歲以上，
我們家小朋友才七歲，所以只好乖乖排隊。通關後提領行李也等了滿久的，感覺好像進入這國家就是不像荷蘭有效率。

出機場前先用歐元現金換了阿爾巴尼亞的貨幣（叫作**Lek**）的現金，因為據多方消息顯示，在阿爾巴尼亞大部份地區付錢都是要付現。不過經過這次旅遊後
我也學到其實現在去阿爾巴尼亞用歐元現金就可以了，因為幾乎所有地方都收歐元現金。大部份地方在結帳的時候換算匯率差不多都是`€1 = 100L`，而我
們當時實際歐元對**Lek**大約是`€1 = 98.6L`，其實也沒有差太多，在機場換匯反而還虧比較多。

換完錢後，在機場內的一家電信商買了可上網的易付卡，感覺不算便宜，但至少一個禮拜絕對夠用。順道一提的是其實也可以事先在網路上買可在特定國家使用
的**eSim**，可省去要買實體SIM卡的時間。我個人是買了一個**eSim**和一個實體SIM卡，因為我帶了兩支手機。

出機場後在出境大廳外就是一排租車行，我出發前早在網路上預訂了車，就直接前往取車。特別的是，他們的油箱規則是是空租空還，這我還是第一次碰到。
租車公司安排了一台`Škoda`油車，稍做檢查後就開車上路了。

機場外交通混亂，路不寬，但車子很多要通過一個很小的圓環，加上（印象中）週邊有施工，大家塞成一團，和台灣某些地方感覺類似。離開機場的時候是下午
約三點左右，預計一個小時後左右可抵達我們預定的民宿。

第一次造訪阿爾巴尼亞，有冒險和躍躍欲試的感覺。本以為經過多次旅行後，這次旅行應該駕輕就熟，沒想到才開始開車就出狀況了：我的手機GPS訊號非常不穩定，
無法正常導航。我發現如果車子行進快速，GPS就抓不到我的位置，但若停下來或是開很慢，Google Maps就可以抓到我的位置。於是，我就開開停停，每開一斷就
找個地方停一下確認我沒有走錯。如此下來原本一小時的路程，加上有些塞車，開了超過一個半小時。

到達民宿所在區域後，沒想到有了新的問題。TODO: explain what happened without proper navigation所以最後大約六點才到民宿，太陽都快要下山了。

- Didn't have time to buy and prepare dinner; just ate instant noodles

Last night I found out the location permission settings of my Android phones were problematic for navigation, i changed it. Then today
the navigation just works smoothly, it makes life much easier and no more taking the wrong paths or stop to recheck our current location.
It just made this trip feel easy again, as enjoyable as to other countries. In fact, it is even more magnificent due to amazing weather
and scenary.

- ~Mesi bridge~ (Water color is beautiful)
- ~Shengan~ (Also a blue eye :); but water color is not as beautiful as Mesi, in my personal view)
- The restaurant near Shengan was also simply brilliant, in fact, it is more enjoyrable than the lake Shengan itself. We had our lunch there. highly recommended.
- Rozafa Castle (The panorama is unbeatable, simply brilliant, can't not skip this one if you're in this region, the best panorama i've had in recent years!)
- Boodschapen doen -> cannot find fresh food in that supermarket. The logic here is a bit different, fresh food is not sold in supermarkt.


## 22.10.2024

- Set off at 6:10am; it was still complete darkness; sun started to go up on the half way to the city
- ~Lake Koman tour (bring your own lunch?)~ (**DONE**) WARNING, bumpy road from shkodra to koman; but it is definitely one of the best boat tour you can have! If you come to this region, don't miss it, although it is a difficult ride (we hired bus/van service to take us from skhoder city to lake koman to take the ferry), the scenary is definitely worth it! We went there in the middle of autumn (last week of October), it can still be chilly in the morning. The weather was fantastic! Really breathtaking scenary!
- Dinner at a restaurant? Yes, Restaurant San Francisco, had the traditional lamb with yogurt ...


## 23.10.2024

- Set off at around 9:30am
- GPS of my phone not working again, swithced to use Flora's phone for navigation.
- Easy road to drive, compared to a lot of unpaved roads in Albania
- The scenary on the road to Theth national park is magnificent; outstanding! Like the host
  of my B&B said, the last our of the drive to Theth is the most mesmorizing, especially now
  in the autumn, the colors were just incredibly beautiful. Theth is a 'must-visit' if you
  come to this region; and it is suitable for deep/immersive travel. (brought your own lunch and
  ate there)
- A pity thing about the trip today was we set off too late, and there was some unexpected
  delays on the road so we couldn't explore all things we wanted to. There are still quite
  some activities to do in this region. We would definitely come back again. It's probably
  best to come again during autumn / fall, the tourists are just much much less, the driving
  experience is rather enjoyable. A unforgettable trip.
- Visited another restaurant in Shengan again for dinner and sunsetting view on the lake. A
  nice restaurant, would recommend people to come here. 


## 24.10.2024

- Rested in the morning at B&B ; read the books I brought.
- Shiroke city tour, not so good experience as I thought, didn't stay long
- Went to vilepoja beach, not so clean either. Nothing special to me there.
  Thinking about going to Shengjin Beach tomorrow.
- Had a simple dinner at Havana Hotel, very close to our B&B
