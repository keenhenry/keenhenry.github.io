The first day is a day full of unexpected things:

- Didn't expect long queues at the custom control
- Didn't expect the long wait at picking up the luggage
- Didn't rent the original car that I booked
- Didn't expect the car is empty return on empty ...
- GPS signal not stable which makes navigation not working smoothly
- Took longer than expected to find our accommodation
- Didn't have time to buy and prepare dinner; just ate instant noodles

Last night I found out the location permission settings of my Android phones were problematic for navigation, i changed it. Then today
the navigation just works smoothly, it makes life much easier and no more taking the wrong paths or stop to recheck our current location.
It just made this trip feel easy again, as enjoyable as to other countries. In fact, it is even more magnificent due to amazing weather
and scenary.

- ~Mesi bridge~ (Water color is beautiful)
- ~Shengan~ (Also a blue eye :); but water color is not as beautiful as Mesi, in my personal view)
- The restaurant near Shengan was also simply brilliant, in fact, it is more enjoyrable than the lake Shengan itself. We had our lunch there. highly recommended.
- Rozafa Castle (The panorama is unbeatable, simply brilliant, can't not skip this one if you're in this region, the best panorama i've had in recent years!)
- Boodschapen doen -> cannot find fresh food in that supermarket. The logic here is a bit different, fresh food is not sold in supermarkt.

- Set off at 6:10am; it was still complete darkness; sun started to go up on the half way to the city
- ~Lake Koman tour (bring your own lunch?)~ (**DONE**) WARNING, bumpy road from shkodra to koman; but it is definitely one of the best boat tour you can have! If you come to this region, don't miss it, although it is a difficult ride (we hired bus/van service to take us from skhoder city to lake koman to take the ferry), the scenary is definitely worth it! We went there in the middle of autumn (last week of October), it can still be chilly in the morning. The weather was fantastic! Really breathtaking scenary!
- Dinner at a restaurant? Yes, Restaurant San Francisco, had the traditional lamb with yogurt ...


## 23.10.2024

- Set off at around 9:30am
- Easy road to drive, compared to a lot of unpaved roads in Albania
- The scenary on the road to Theth national park is magnificent; outstanding! Like the host
  of my B&B said, the last our of the drive to Theth is the most mesmorizing, especially now
  in the autumn, the colors were just incredibly beautiful. Theth is a 'must-visit' if you
  come to this region; and it is suitable for deep/immersive travel. (brought your own lunch and
  ate there)
- A pity thing about the trip today was we set off too late, and there was some unexpected
  delays on the road so we couldn't explore all things we wanted to. There are still quite
  some activities to do in this region. We would definitely come back again. It's probably
  best to come again during autumn / fall, the tourists are just much much less, the driving
  experience is rather enjoyable. A unforgettable trip.
- Visited another restaurant in Shengan again for dinner and sunsetting view on the lake. A
  nice restaurant, would recommend people to come here.
