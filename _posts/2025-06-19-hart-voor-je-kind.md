I have many quesitons over taking care of my child emotionally. I am still struggling about how I can help my daughter develop
her *emotional intelligence*. Thus, I bought a 2nd-handed book **Hart Voor Je Kind**; and this post is documenting what I've learned
after reading this book.

According to the author, there are only two types of parents: one paying the emotional deveopment of their children and the other not.

For the ones that do not, that can be further divided into3 catgories:

- un-receptive
- rejective and disapproval: parents that are critical about the negative feelings of their child.
- let-it-be type

5-step emotional coaching:

1. Being aware of the emotions of the child.
2. TODO
