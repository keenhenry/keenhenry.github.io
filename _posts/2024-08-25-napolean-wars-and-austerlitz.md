This post is a follow-up post of [Dinant trip post](/posts/dinant-waterloo-trip).

After visiting Waterloo in Belgium, my curiosity aroused so that I wanted to know more about
the so-called [Napolean Wars][napolean-wars].

There were so many battles in the Napolean Wars, I was particularly curious about the [Battle of Austerlitz][austerlitz],
French invasion of Russia and the Battle of Waterloo.
