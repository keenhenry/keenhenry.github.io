Things I want to keep reminding myself:

- Do what you like, like what you do, it is a good life.
- Patience is a virtue.
- See the essence, not the appearance.
- 緣分不能強求，一切隨緣
- 世界所有塵，一一塵中見
- To teach is to learn; the best way to learn is to teach
- Take it easy, hakuna matata.
- Do not care what people are thinking about you, you do not live in somebody else's expectation.
- 技道心
