Disclaimer:

I do not work for LingQ and I don't get paid to publish this post. I made this post only for sharing useful information regarding learning languages.
I started using LingQ since around 9 months ago and saw the tangible impacts this service has made on my language learning journey. That is why I want
to spread the words, hopefully, this helps your language learning journey as well.


## What is LingQ?

[**LingQ**][1] is a language learning platform for everyone. It currently offers around 30 'popular' languages on its platform, and many more are coming (now in *Beta* mode) in the future.
You can access it via the Web interface, or, by using its mobile app, which is available via **Google Play** and **Apple Store**. One of the founders of LingQ is Steve Kaufmann. He is a famous
ployglot teaching people how to learn languages [on YouTube][lingosteve].

You can use the service/app for free but then the functionalities are quite limited. Check out its pricing options at [this page][price] and decide for yourself.


## Why am I using it?

TODO: (First, a bit background of my Dutch learning journey)

Around one and a half years ago, I started learning Dutch seriously by myself. I've tried consuming all kinds of language learning contents.


TODO: (During the journey, wat I have found?)

According to my exprience, effective language learning happens when I am exposed to lots of contents (inputs) in the target language. Contents that have meaningful
contexts. Good quality, interesting contents keep you motivated.

Reading and listening materials are the language inputs I have easy access to. But to find good / high quality contents that match your language level needs a bit of
searching and patience. In addition, for the listening materials, I also found that, at least at the beginner to early intermediate level, I need transcripts or texts
from the contents I listen to to be able to pick up vocabularies more quickly and effectively. And it would be nice to keep track of all the vocabularies I have learned
so far and review them from time to time.

TODO: (Describe how you came across the app and the experience of using it and how it satisfies your needs)

After I started the language learning journey, I consumed language learning videos on YouTube quite regularly. I came across the contents from Steve and knew
about his LingQ app. At the beginning, I was skeptical, and I didn't want to pay for such service.
