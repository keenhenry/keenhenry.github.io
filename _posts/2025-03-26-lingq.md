## What is LingQ?

[**LingQ**][1] is a language learning platform for everyone. It currently offers around 30 'popular' languages on its platform, and many more are coming (now in *Beta* mode) in the future.
You can access it via the Web interface, or, by using its mobile app, which is available via **Google Play** and **Apple Store**. One of the founders of LingQ is Steve Kaufmann. He is a famous
ployglot teaching people how to learn languages [on YouTube][lingosteve].

You can use the service/app for free but then the functionalities are quite limited. Check out its pricing options at [this page][price] and decide for yourself.


## Why am I using it?

Just a disclaimer, I am not a sales person for LingQ, I don't get paid to promte LingQ, I am spreading words about this service because I from the bottom of my heart found this service
really useful/helpful for learning languages.

Around two years ago, I decided to learn Dutch more seriously, I was searching for good learning materials on YouTube. Surprisingly, I found the content from Steve.
