Disclaimer:

I do not work for LingQ and I don't get paid to publish this post. I made this post only for sharing useful information regarding learning languages.
I started using LingQ since around 9 months ago and saw the tangible impacts this service has made on my language learning journey. That is why I want
to spread the words, hopefully, this helps your language learning journey as well.


## What is LingQ?

[**LingQ**][1] is a language learning platform for everyone. It currently offers roughly 30 'popular' languages, and many more are coming (now in *Beta* mode) in the future.
You can access it via the Web interface, or, by using its mobile app, which is available via **Google Play** and **Apple Store**. One of the founders of LingQ is Steve Kaufmann.
He is a famous ployglot teaching people how to learn languages [on YouTube][lingosteve].

You can use the service/app for free but then the functionalities are quite limited. Check out its pricing options at [this page][price] and decide for yourself.


## Why am I using it?

TODO: (First, a bit background of my Dutch learning journey)

Around one and a half years ago, I started learning Dutch seriously by myself. I've tried consuming all kinds of language learning contents. At first,
I spent a lot of time listening to Dutch contents, including podcasts, YouTube videos, online courses, Dutch TV programs, etc. Then I started reading
as well. The reading materials were local newspaper and kid's books at the beginning, and, later with books (for adults) that interest me.

TODO: (During the journey, wat I have found?)

According to my exprience, effective language learning happens when I am exposed to lots of contents (inputs) in the target language. Contents that have meaningful
contexts. Good quality, interesting contents keep you motivated.

*Reading* and *listening* materials are the language inputs I have easy access to. But to find high quality contents that match your language level and interests needs
a bit of searching and patience. In addition, for the listening materials, I also found that, at least at the beginner to early intermediate level, I need **transcripts**
or texts from the contents I listen to to be able to pick up vocabularies more quickly and effectively. And I need a way of **keeping track** of all the vocabularies I have
learned so far and reviewing them from time to time.

TODO: (Describe how you came across the app and the experience of using it and how it satisfies your needs)

As mentioned, I consumed a lot of learning materials on YouTube. One day, I came across the contents from Steve and learned about his LingQ app. I liked how Steve approached
language learning: both the mentality and the methodology are rather motivating for language learners like me. That is why I got curious about the LingQ app. However, I used
other language learning Apps before, including [`Duolingo`][duolingo]. With Duolingo, I felt I couldn't progress much further after I had reached some basic language proficiency
in a target language, therefore, I was also skeptical about the effectiveness of LingQ at first.

Even so, I decided to try the free version anyway and see how it goes. In the free version, it already offered me lots of interesting audio contents with transcripts. That's
also where I learned about many Dutch language content creators I did not know. In addition, the audio contents are categorized under different subjects, for example, history,
entertainment, culture, travel, technology, health, news, etc, so you can broaden your vocabulary by trying different subjects.
