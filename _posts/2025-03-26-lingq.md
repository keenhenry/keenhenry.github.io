A disclaimer:

I do not work for LingQ and I don't get paid to publish this post. I made this post only for sharing useful information regarding learning languages.
I started using LingQ since around 9 months ago and saw the tangible impacts this service has made on my language learning journey. That is why I want
to spread the words, hopefully, this helps your language learning journey as well.


## What is LingQ?

[**LingQ**][1] is a language learning platform for everyone. It currently offers around 30 'popular' languages on its platform, and many more are coming (now in *Beta* mode) in the future.
You can access it via the Web interface, or, by using its mobile app, which is available via **Google Play** and **Apple Store**. One of the founders of LingQ is Steve Kaufmann. He is a famous
ployglot teaching people how to learn languages [on YouTube][lingosteve].

You can use the service/app for free but then the functionalities are quite limited. Check out its pricing options at [this page][price] and decide for yourself.


## Why am I using it?

I have learned from my exprience that effective language learning happens when I am exposed to lots of contents in the target language. Contents that have meaningful
contexts. TODO: Around two years ago, I decided to learn Dutch more seriously, I was searching for good learning materials on YouTube. Surprisingly, I found the content
from Steve.
