A few days ago, I bought the [ultralearning book][1]. I heard about this book a while ago, I decided to
have a read for myself out of curiosity.

After reading a few chapters in the book, I am really tempted to apply the methodologies/principles
described in the book to things I want to learn or even things never thought about.

I know I am a passionate learner; learning makes me feel alive. However, I didn't always reach the
results/goals I had hoped for for the things I tried to learn. Now having some unique perspectives
and ideas suggested from this book, I wonder if I could learn things differently than before and
achieve results I could not imagine previously, or even better, turn a new page in my life.

'Why not?' I told myself. Life is now. Let's do it.

The first ultralearning project I am going to do is learning Dutch; to put it more concretely:

__Reach B2 level of Dutch language (in listening, speaking and reading) in 6 months.__

My current level of Dutch language is at A2. It has been at this level for many years. I always
have some interests in learning languages, because I get to access to different cultures and
perspectives via doing so. However, due to my lifestyle in the Netherlands and my day job, I didn't
put serious efforts on learning Dutch. Now my daughter is growing fast and learning lots of things
from school, I feel that I might not be able to keep up with her soon and not able to help her
with the school assignments, therefore, there is no excuse anymore.

In addition, we would be able to integrate more deeply with Dutch society if our language capability
is higher. Being able to use a language easily should open up more opportunities and possibilities. I
really wonder how far I can go as Dutch is my second foreign language. If this goes well, that means
I can go on to learn other languages and other difficult things, that should make my life more interesting.

Let's start this first project in November 2023. Hopefully, at the end of the project, I will be able to
conclude that I have learned how to learn effectively. From now on, I will use this blog to document the
progress and findings along the way. Wish me luck!
