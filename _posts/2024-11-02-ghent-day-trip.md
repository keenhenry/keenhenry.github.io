## Foreword

Several weeks ago a friend of mine and I made a deal to have a day trip somewhere on this day. Until
a few days ago I told this friend: 'I still had no idea where to go on the coming Saturday.' The friend
then said he actually wants to go to Ghent.

To me it was definitely a good choice and coincidently it was already on my *to-visit* list so I agreed
to this place without hesitation.


## Hit The Road

We got up late on Saturday, as we always do. So did the family of my friend. We then set off rather late
in the morning, at around `10:20AM`.

There was no traffic at all on Saturday morning, even when passing the notorious Antwerp ring. On Belgian
highway we could drive at `120km/hour`, which also made it feel a lot faster. Eventually, without detour or
getting lost, we arrived at the destined parking lot (which is literally at the city center of Ghent) a few
minutes before noon.


## First Impression of Ghent

The first impression of Ghent when driving into the city was - what a crowded place! Ghent was no *cozy-little-tourist*
place to me; it felt like a medium-sized (and it is) city, perhaps even comparable to Eindhoven. Lots of tram lines can
be observed within the city center, which is in line with other bigger cities in Europe.

What differs from Eindhoven is, well, it has a very beautiful medieval city center. Many buildings are the typical **Flemish**
[**stepped gables**][stepped-gable], especially along the rivers. According to Wikipedia, the oldest stepped gables are at
**Graslei** in Ghent. In addition to the stepped gables, there are other beauties; for example, Saint Bavo's Cathedral (Brabantine
Gothic), Saint Nicolass Church and Belfry of Ghent. These buildings decorates the city skyline very well. In summary, it is a
medieval architectural feast.


## **Het Lam Gods**

My main goal of visiting Ghent today is to see the masterpiece from Jan van Eyck - Het Lam God. After parking our car at
a parking lot (De Reep, TODO: put gmap link) very close to Saint Bavo's Cathedral, we walked towards the cathedral where the
**Ghent Altarpiece** (also called **The Mystic Lamb**; and in Dutch it's called **Het Lam Gods**) is in.

Standing in front of the cathedral, it was already around noon time and we booked the visiting session starting at `13:30PM`,
therefore, we decided to have lunch before going in. Coincidentally, right across the street was a Chinese noodles' restaurant
(Seli's Noodlebar; TODO: gmap link) standing, just what I needed! We went right in without any hesitation. Some moments later
my friend and his family also arrived and met us in the restaurant. The food was decent and was not expensive (I ordered beef
noodle soup and it was around â‚¬15).

Not long after lunch, we walked back to Saint Bavo's Cathedral for the altarpiece.

The catholic cathedral was magnificent. There were a lot of tourists when we were there. Many of them were lined up to buy the
tickets to see the altarpiece as well. We already bought the tickets online, so we just skipped the line and went right in. The
altarpiece was located in the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, which is exactly at the eastmost side of the cathedral. It was
indeed a masterpiece:

_The Mystic Lamb_

First of all, it was huge when all the panels were opened (which was the case when we were there)! Second, it was first painted
by Jan van Eyck's brother and finished later by Jan van Eyck. Each panel was depicting a story in the bible.
