description: A day in Ghent
---

Several weeks ago a friend of mine and I made a deal to have a day trip somewhere on this day. Until
a few days ago I told my friend: 'I still had no idea where to go in the coming Saturday.' The friend
then said he actually wants to go to Ghent.

To me it was definitely a good choice and coincidently it was already on my to-visit list and I had plans
to go there earlier this passed summer but didn't because of changed plans.
