## Foreword

Several weeks ago a friend of mine and I made a deal to have a day trip somewhere on this day. Until
a few days ago I told this friend: 'I still had no idea where to go on the coming Saturday.' The friend
then said he actually wants to go to Ghent.

To me it was definitely a good choice and coincidently it was already on my *to-visit* list so I agreed
to this place without hesitation.


## Hit The Road

We got up late on Saturday, as we always do. So did the family of my friend. We then set off rather late
in the morning, at around `10:20AM`.

There was no traffic at all on Saturday morning, even when passing the notorious Antwerp ring. On Belgian
highway we could drive at `120km/hour`, which also made it feel a lot faster. Eventually, without detour or
getting lost, we arrived at the destined parking lot (which is literally at the city center of Ghent) a few
minutes before noon.


## First Impression of Ghent

The first impression of Ghent when driving into the city was - what a crowded place! Ghent was no *cozy-little-tourist*
place; it felt like a medium-sized (and it is), perhaps even comparable to Eindhoven. Lots of tram lines can be observed
within city center area, which is also the case in bigger cities of Europe.

TODO: more description about first impression of the city
The city definitely has the **Flemish** feel - streets packed with narrow buidlings in light colors. Architectures and the
skyline are beautiful.
