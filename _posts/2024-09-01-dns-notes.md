## What is DNS?

Domain Name System is a service/protocol that provides **Name Resolution** funtionality.

**Name Resolution** is the process of converting domain names (human-readable words as web addresses)
into IP addresses ([dot-decimal notation][ddn]), which can be understood by computers.


## Why DNS?

Humans are bad at remembering numbers, we simply cannot remember all the websites' addresses in IP numbers.
In addition, with the help of DNS service, you can then change a website's IP address without changing the
corresponding domain name, thus making the web more 'predictable'.


## How does DNS work?

To provide such service, there exist many DNS server(s) to fulfill the job. They are the backbone of internet.
In simple terms, what happens is that the 'client computer/program' makes a DNS lookup request to the DNS
system (comprised of a group of servers), and the system eventually responds with the correct
IP address of the requested domain name to the client. From this, you can easily deduce that DNS service,
just like many other networked services, follows the 'Client-Server' model of communication.

As indicated above, DNS lookup could (for example, a full lookup) involve many name servers. These servers
exchange information in a *hierarchical* manner before eventually giving back the final answer to the client.

To elaborate, different DNS name servers are playing different 'roles' during serving a DNS lookup request.
These different roles forms the hierarchical nature of communication. There are *five* main such roles of
name servers:

Caching name servers (provided by ISP or local network)
: Store known domain name lookups for a certain amount of time (provided by ISP or local network)
  so that a full DNS lookup can be avoided.

Recursive name servers (provided by ISP or local network)
: Performs full DNS resolution requests. A local name server is typically both a caching and recursive
  name server; in other words, the functinalities of both roles are fulfilled in one server. So, for a
  DNS lookup request, if the local name server cannot find a cached lookup request/response, it then
  performs a recursive DNS lookup on behalf of the client, and once the answer of the request is found,
  then it caches the new response. This is the server that's directly contacted by the DNS client.

Root name servers
: 13 Authorities that provide root name lookups as a service. Responsible for directing the queries to
  the right TLD name servers. These servers are always the first ones to contact during the full DNS
  lookup.

TLD (Top-Level Domain) name servers
: Represents top of the hierarchical DNS name resolution system. A TLD name is the last part of a domain
  name. For example **.com** in www.facebook.com. A TLD name server is responsible for directing the
  query to the correct authoritative name servers.

Authoritative name servers
: Name servers that are responsible for translating the last two parts of the domain name to correct
  IP address (for example, for a request of looking up **facebook.com**, it may respond with IP w.x.y.z).

Given the roles described above, we can easily visualize the hierarchy as follows (root name servers
at the top):

  A(root name servers) -->|knows| B
  B(TLD name servers)  -->|knows| C
  C(authoritative name servers)
```

Equipped with the basic knowledge of what each component in a DNS system does, let's now see how all of
them work together in the action of a full DNS lookup:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant User
    participant Caching/recursive name server
    participant Root name server
    participant TLD name server
    participant Authoritative name server
    User->>Caching/recursive name server: DNS lookup request
    Caching/recursive name server->>Root name server: TLD lookup request
    Root name server->>Caching/recursive name server: The TLD name server that should be queried
    Caching/recursive name server->>TLD name server: Authoritative name server lookup request
    TLD name server->>Caching/recursive name server: Redirect to the corresponding Authoritative name servers
    Caching/recursive name server->>Authoritative name server: DNS lookup for the corresponding domain
    Authoritative name server->>Caching/recursive name server: Response with actual IP of the server in question
    Caching/recursive name server->>User: Response with actual IP of the server in question
```

It is easy to notice that there is a lot of message exchange for a full DNS lookup! That's why
we need caching mechanism (e.g. caching name server) in the system! In addition to that, the client
(your desktop computer, moblie phone, laptop, table, etc.) itself also caches DNS lookup responses
to avoid even looking up again! To make expensive DNS lookup faster, DNS usually uses **UDP** as its
transport layer protocol under the hood (DNS itself is an **application layer** protocol).

Please note that root name servers and TLD name servers are usually distributed globally, with many servers
sharing the same IP address. For the local name server to find _ONE_ root/TLD name server to contact to, it
uses a technique called __Anycast__[^anycast]. It is basically a _one-to-one-of-many_[^routing-wiki] message
delivery scheme where usually the nearst node is picked as the message destination.


### DNS resource types

DNS operates with a set of different resource types. This allows different kinds of DNS resolution.

A record
: Point a certain domain name at a certain IPv4 address. This is the most common/basic DNS record in use.

Quad A record
: Similar to A record, but returns an IPv6 address instead of IPv4 address.

CNAME (Canonical Name) record
: Used to redirect traffic from one domain name to another. Super commonly used. This
  allows the website to have only one canonical IP address for multiple domain names. And whenever you
  need to change the IP address for the service, you only need to change ONE IP address for all the related
  domain name.

MX (Mail Exchange) record
: Used to deliver email to the correct server. Only used for mail services.

SRV (Service) record
: Used to define the location of various specific services. Can be used for many different specific services.

TXT (Text) record
: Originally intended to be used only for associating some descriptive
  text with a domain name for human consumption. Nowadays it is used to
  communicate configuration preferences about network services.

NS (Name Server) record
: Indicate other name servers that might also be responsible for this zone.
