This post is a follow-up post of [Dinant trip post](/posts/dinant-waterloo-trip).

After visiting Waterloo in Belgium, my curiosity aroused so that I wanted to know more about
the so-called [Napolean Wars][napolean-wars].

There were so many battles in Napolean Wars, I was particularly curious about the [Battle of Austerlitz][austerlitz],
[French invasion of Russia][??] and the [Battle of Waterloo][??].

We visited the war memorial in Waterloo. Needlessly to say that Battle of Waterloo was the final defeat of Napolean
and after that he was sent to exile in Saint Helena island in Africa. It was a bloody battle and many people died.

French invasion of Russia was a miserable defeat of Napolean and his army. The story of this battle/invasion was also
fascinating; it was a war of attrition, and Russian army even set Moscow aflame! It's a people that knew/knows how to let go
and sacrifice for the greater goal! Never mess up with the Russians!

Battle of Austerlitz occurred in a town now located in Czech Republic. It was one of the most successful battle for Napolean,
a battle against the coalition of Austria and Russia. It was a decisive victory which consolidated the status of French Empire.

I was curious where 'Austerlitz' is, and when I tried to find where the town is in my search engine, I first found the place name
called Austerlitz in the Netherlands! And there is a connection between this place in the Netherlands and the actual battle
that happened 200 years ago (1805). In order to know more about this place, I planned a trip to Austerlitz in the Netherlands.
